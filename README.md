# Bass Invader

Is that even music coming from your room? Don't let grandma cut you off.

A port of the first game I ever made to Scala using the [Indigo Game Engine](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo).

## Controls

The game is a very simple Space Invaders clone. Use the arrow keys to move and Space to shoot.

## Running the game

The easiest way to run the game is with the following command:

```bash
sbt runGame
```

This will run it locally using Electron.

## A note on music

TODO 
To get around any copyright issues, there is no background music file checked in. Just drop an MP3 file named `background.mp3` into the assets repository before running it.
